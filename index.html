    The world of web animations has become a sprawling jungle of tools and
    technologies. Libraries like GSAP and Framer Motion and React Spring have
    sprung up to help us add motion to the DOM. The most fundamental and
    critical piece, though, is the humble CSS transition. It's the first
    animation tool that most front-end devs learn, and it's a workhorse. Even
    the most grizzled, weathered animation veterans still reach for this tool
    often. There's a surprising amount of depth to this topic. In this tutorial,
    we'll dig in and learn a bit more about CSS transitions, and how we can use
    them to create lush, polished animations. The world of web animations has
